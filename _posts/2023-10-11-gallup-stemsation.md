On October 11, 2023, Franklin Stewart participated in STEM-sation at Gallup High School.  STEM-sation is sponsored by various Native American organizations throughout the Navajo Nation and regional Four Corners area.  Representing 4CSCC, Franklin shared scientific computing resources and materials for Gallup High School students and staff.  The event started with an assembly featuring STEM-sation's sponsors and vendors, who shared and presented their backgrounds in STEM, mostly emphasizing environmental awareness and education i.e., monitoring abandoned uranium mines, informing higher education funds/grants, and working with and building 100% Navajo-owned companies.  

Following the assembly, students interacted with numerous vendors and booths.   Often involving scientific experiments and computing exercises, which were very informative and exciting for each participant.  Individual experiments at each table helped every vendor stand out, their material had relevant information for the event. The booths were informative about environmental education and STEM.

Participating in these events allows us to enhance and expose the 4CSCC curriculum to future, upcoming STEM leaders.  Sharing the 4CSCC Raspberry Pi 400 mobile kit with data sensors displays current readings of the room.  The event started at 8:00 AM and lasted till 2:45 PM, the sessions lasted 45-55 minutes, with 7 sessions in total.  We can experiment with 4CSCC lessons with students while accomplishing our mission and goal.  Observing the data sensors in real time provided data to share regarding the air quality, particulate matter, and temperature/humidity.  "This type of presentation extends our 4CSCC reach," states Franklin, "more students get exposed to applications and learn about careers in STEM."  

Franklin shares, "This was my second time participating in STEM-sation, my first STEM-sation was at Monument Valley High School earlier this year (April 2023).  It's a grand sight to see Indigenous representatives share their knowledge, resources, and expertise, I didn't see much Native representation at events such as this while I was a teenager."  These shared experiences and opportunities are a great way to give back and show future generations they can accomplish their dreams.  Stewart continues, "One goal of mine is to increase the diversity, inclusion, and awareness of Native American students in STEM, particularly Navajo.  I would love to see more take an interest in STEM industries."
