On August 1st, at Fort Lewis College, Dr. Joslynn Lee, hosted two students and two teachers from Southern Ute tribe. "It was a great session, even with the small group, the students were really excited to start a club. One of them was really excited to use Scratch and wanted to keep working on that, not so much python." 

Pending her teaching schedule this Fall, she is considering meeting on Fridays regularly. Dr. Lee aims to recruit AISES students or computing engineering students to help out with 4CSCC.

The local tribal paper showed up and took some great photos.
